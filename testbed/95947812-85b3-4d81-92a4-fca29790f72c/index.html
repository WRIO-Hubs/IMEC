             "The HP206C employs a MEMS pressure sensor with an I2C interface to provide accurate temperature, pressure or altitude data.The sensor pressure and temperature outputs are digitized by a high resolution 24-bit ADC. The altitude value is calculated by a specific patented algorithm according to the pressure and temperature data. Data compensation is integrated internally to save the effort of the external host MCU system. Easy command-based data acquisition interface and programmable interrupt control is available. Typical active supply current is 5.3μA per measurement-second while the ADC output is filtered and decimated by 256. Pressure output can be resolved with output in fractions of a Pascal, and altitude can be resolved in 0.1 meter. Package is surface mount with a stainless steel cap and is RoHS compliant. "
