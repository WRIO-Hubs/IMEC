        "Stage 1 resulted in an experiment that allowed the creation of the Proof of Concept (PoC). The PoC includes rendering of pages and their enhanced structure based on actual data collected from the Testbed sensors. Pages are stored in the machine-readable format JSON-LD (key:value). Sensors are displayed as a simple dashboard with an option to go to the sensor page and to visualise its data as a chart. The sensor page includes several sections: General Info, Product Profile and Feed. Thus, we gained a technical basis that will become a solid foundation for the further development of the Project at Stage 2.",

        "Stage 2: MVP. The IoT WRIO platform will become a “Facebook for smart devices”. The solution will be used to create and maintain profiles (IDs/passports and even wallets) and social media feeds for smart devices automatically. The platform will allow devices tracking from the moment of their development through recycling: manufacturer, date of manufacture; seller, selling time; warranty service; geolocation, usage, errors and maintenance logs; etc. IoT WRIO platform will store full particulars of registered IoT devices, track and log data transferred by them — a distributed and API-free database of open, shareable and reusable smart devices data.",

        "During the registration every device will be assigned a blockchain address based on the hashed manufacturer ID or any other unique parameter, which will be linked to the owner’s address, thus enabling a secure authorized control over the device. The address will store the device’s metadata and will be linked to the device profile in a secure and machine-readable (semantic) key:value format that can be accessed without limitation. Such a decentralized machine-readable profiled database will enable automatic reading and processing of IoT big data, and will allow creating new business opportunities, insights and unique IoT services.",
